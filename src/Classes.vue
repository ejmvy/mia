            <h3>Acryllic Pour Classes</h3>
            <p>
              This workshop will introduce you to the world of acrylic pouring.
              It being a relatively new medium in the art world, only being in
              existence for the last few years. The number of places that teach
              it are extremely limited in ireland, but now classes and workshops
              are available in Dublin City Centre. This workshop will teach you
              acrylic pouring from the basics, its theory and the many, many
              techniques that can be used to create some truly incredible and
              unique pieces of art. After learning the basics of acrylic
              pouring, Mia went on to explore the medium further and delve into
              & cultivate new techniques and developing a uniquely crafted style
              and approach to the modern medium. Students will learn several
              different techniques, each of which will be demonstrated in detail
              by your tutor. All materials will be included in the price, but
              students will be required to bring and wear a mask in accordance
              with the guidelines / health and safety advice from the government
              and the HSE. Students are also advised to either bring an apron
              for the class, or wear clothes that you donâ€™t mind getting some
              paint on.
